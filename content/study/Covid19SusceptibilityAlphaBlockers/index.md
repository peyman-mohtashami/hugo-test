  description: "This study will evaluate the association between prevalent use of alpha-1 blockers (É‘-1B) and the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection and of subsequently requiring hospitalization and intensive services such as mechanical ventilation.\nThe analysis will be undertaken across a federated multi-national network of electronic health records and administrative claims from primary care and secondary care that have been mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model in collaboration with the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) and European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) initiatives.\nThese data reflect the clinical experience of patients from six European countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, and Estonia) the United Kingdom, the United States of America, South Korea, and Japan as data becomes available.\nWe will use a prevalent user cohort design to estimate the relative risk of each outcome using an on-treatment analysis of monotherapy.\nData driven approaches will be used to identify potential covariates for inclusion in matched or stratified propensity score models identified using regularized logistic regression.\nLarge-scale propensity score matching and stratification strategies that allow balancing on a large number of baseline potential confounders will be used in addition to negative control outcomes to allow for evaluating residual bias in the study design as a whole as a diagnostic step.\nThis study is part of the [OHDSI 2020 COVID-19 study-a-thon](https://www.ohdsi.org/covid-19-updates/)."
