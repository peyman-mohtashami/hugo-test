  description: 'The objective of the study is to assess the comparative effectiveness of famotidine and reduced severity of outcome (death or need for intensive services) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus use of PPIs, hydroxychloroquine or non-use of famotidine.  This study will also assess the comparative effectiveness of 2nd generation H1 histamine receptor antagonists for reduced risk of death or intensive services in hospitalized COVID-19 patients versus montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, with similar indications as the H1 histamine receptor antagonist group.
